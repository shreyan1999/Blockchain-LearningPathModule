# Introduction

With developing technologies, it is believed that the world wants a new, better web where the entire planet’s population can communicate without having to rely on big companies that amass our data and make it easier for governments to conduct surveillance. This new web technology is called DWeb or Decentralized Web. 

With the current web, all that user data concentrated in the hands of a few creates risk that our data will be hacked. If any of these entities shuts down, our data and connections are all lost.  That’s where the decentralized web comes into picture. It is supposed to be like the web you know but without relying on centralised operators.

Blockchain is a secure, encrypted technology that cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. It provides decentralized transactions which tracks ownership securely in a trustworthy environment. While the initial applications of blockchain technology were built for currency transactions digitally, the same technology is now being used for building application for the development of DWeb. 

With the change in web versions, there will be changes in the back-end development as well. Due to very less resources available for the same, building these applications based on the concept of decentralisation can get complex for beginners. For this purpose, this module is based on creating applications on azure with decentralised ecosystem using blockchain for the new web versions. 

## Scenario

Do you know? In the early days when the world wide web came into existence, you connected directly with your friends through desktop computers that talked to each other. But from the early 2000s, with the invention of Web 2.0, we began to communicate with each other and share information through centralised services provided by big companies.

Another Scenario to know could be that there are privacy concerns stemming from the business models of many of the companies, which use the private information we provide freely to target us with ads.

The DWeb is about re-decentralising things. This makes sure that we aren’t reliant on any intermediaries for communication. Instead, users keep control of their data, connect, interact and exchange messages directly with others in their network.
 
## What will I Learn?

In this module, you will learn how to:

- Deploy Quorum Dev QuickStart
- Set up your blockchain
- Obtain the RPC endpoint

## What is the main objective?

This module will help users learn to build applications easily on azure with the concept of decentralisation using blockchain.

## Pre-requisites

- Basic knowledge of Node.js
- Basic knowledge on resource groups and subscriptions on Azure
