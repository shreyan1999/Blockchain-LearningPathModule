# Summary

In this module we learn the steps involved to deploy a private blockchain on Azure using the Quorum Devkit by Consensys on Azure. Firstly, we deployed the resource and we saw all the underlying components like Virtual Machine, Network interface, Virtual Network, Disk, Public IP address, Network Security group. From this we chose the Virtual Machine and used the SSH method to access the Virtual Machine using the client named **PuTTY**.  

Then we installed the Quorum dev QuickStart on the virtual machine. Then moved to the user directory where we ran the command to setup the blockchain. Finally, we obtained the RPC endpoint that we will be using in the further steps in the next module to setup Azure Blockchain Workbench.
